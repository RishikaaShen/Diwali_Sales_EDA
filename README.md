### Project Overview

### Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on Diwali Sales

### About the Project:

Exploratory Data Analysis on Diwali Sales delves into customer behavior and sales trends during the one of the most significant shopping seasons of the year.

### Objective: 

The main objective of this project is to analyze prominent patterns such as which gender is more active in making purchases, which age group leads in terms of purchase volume, which product is bought the most, which type of occupation has the highest number of buyers and how sales is varied across different states.

### Key Activities:

**1. Data Understanding and Cleaning**

Loading the Data: Import the dataset into a suitable tool (Python).
Inspecting the Data: View data dimensions, column names, and data types.
Handling Missing Values: Detect and impute or remove missing values.
Removing Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate entries.
Correcting Errors: Fix inconsistencies, such as spelling errors in product names.

**2. Descriptive Statistics**

Identify common categories in categorical features (top-selling products).

**3. Correlation Analysis**

Identify relationships between features (correlation between gender and sales).
Use scatter plots or heatmaps to visualize relationships.

**4. Data Visualization**

Use plots to reveal insights:
Bar Charts: Top-selling products or regions.
Pie Charts: Customer demographics.
Line Graphs: Time series of sales trends.
Box Plots: Distribution of transaction values.

**5. Insights and Recommendations**

Highlight which products or regions contribute most sales.

### Toolkit used for the project: 
**Data Analysis and Visualization Toolkit**

**Libraries:**

**pandas:**  Used for data manipulation

### After importing the libraries:

**1.Loading the data:**

Once the required libraries are imported, the next step is to load the CSV file into the environment for analysis.

**2.Inspecting the Data:**

Inspecting the data helps us gain an initial understanding of the dataset's structure, identify missing or inconsistent values, and determine its readiness for further analysis. This step typically includes checking the number of rows and columns, column names, data types, and a preview of the dataset.

**3.Handling Missing Values:**

Handling missing values is crucial to ensure the dataset is complete and reliable, as missing data can distort analysis and lead to inaccurate insights. This step includes removing rows or columns with excessive missing data.

**4.Correcting Errors:**

Correcting errors involves identifying and fixing inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the dataset, such as typos, incorrect data formats, or out-of-range values. This step ensures that the data is accurate and suitable for analysis.
For example, let's rename a column

After completing these steps, we can proceed to perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset.

-ðŸ“ˆ To visualize the distribution of gender in the dataset, we can plot a bar chart using Seaborn's countplot function, which will display the count of each gender category.
